# QR-Code-Encryption-and-Compression-System

This project, adapted from a project for ESC190 (Data Structures and Algorithms), involves four general "tasks":

1. Converting ASCII messages to binary messages, and vice versa.
2. Generating QR codes (converting messages into multi-dimensional arrays) and reading QR codes (converting arrays to messages).
3. Compressing and decompressing messages by converting between binary and hexadecimal messages.
4. Calculating the Levenshtein Distance between two messages (the minimum number of insertion, deletion, or substitution operations required to convert between two messages).

For the latter task, a dynamic programming approach was used. The project passed all test cases and received a mark of 100%.
